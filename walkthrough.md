# Walkthrough — AI Business Insights, Google Business Reply Publishing Flow & Chrome INP Optimization

Overview of the implementation for upgrading the Raporlar (Reports) dashboard's **AI Business Insights**, **5 Kritik Aksiyon Önerisi** (5 Critical Actions), **Google Business Profile (GBP) Reply Publishing** flow, and UI thread responsiveness enhancements targeting **Chrome INP (Interaction to Next Paint)**.

## 1. Upgraded 5 Critical Action Recommendations with Resolution
- **Balanced 3-Column Layout**:
  - Re-adjusted the actions list limit to exactly **5 items**, aligning perfectly with the height of the Issues (5 items) and Highlights (5 items) columns.
  - Keeps the dashboard layout highly balanced, compact, and premium.
- **"Aksiyon Alındı" Action Resolution Flow**:
  - Added an **"Aksiyon Alındı"** button under each recommendation.
  - Clicking the button prompts the user for confirmation: *"Bu aksiyon önerisini tamamlandı olarak işaretlemek istiyor musunuz?"*
  - On confirm, registers the action as completed in both a local state array (for immediate transition effects) and the Supabase database.
  - Displays a clean success toast alert: *"Aksiyon tamamlandı olarak işaretlendi."*
- **Stable Resolution Keys (Global across Date Ranges)**:
  - Generates a unique, stable `action_key` using the `hotel_id`, normalized lowercase action title, and category. **By omitting the source period, once an action is resolved in one date range, it is globally hidden across all other date filters (e.g. Today, 7D, 30D, This Month) for that hotel.**
  - Safe against duplicate registrations.
- **Supabase Integration & Fallback**:
  - Created a database migration file: **`supabase/migrations/20260702202000_create_action_resolutions.sql`** to establish the `action_resolutions` table.
  - Created a second migration file: **`supabase/migrations/20260702203000_update_action_resolutions_unique.sql`** to alter the unique constraint on `(hotel_id, action_key)`.
  - Before rendering, the reports component queries completed keys from the `action_resolutions` table matching the active hotel.
  - **Graceful Fallback**: If the migration is not yet applied, the dashboard intercepts table exceptions, logs a console alert, and handles resolutions cleanly in memory (local state) without crashing.
- **Priority Labels (ÖNCELİK 1 to ÖNCELİK 5)**:
  - Added clean visual badges (`Öncelik 1` to `Öncelik 5`) dynamically rendered on the right side of each action row container.
- **Category Icon Indicators**:
  - Automatically prepends category-specific Lucide icons next to each recommendation based on its source category classification.
- **Bottom Information Updates**:
  - Displays the total count of analyzed reviews in the card footer: *"Bu aksiyon önerileri seçilen tarih aralığında analiz edilen X yorum üzerinden AI tarafından oluşturulmuştur."*
  - Automatically prints the exact last updated timestamp: *"Son Güncelleme: DD.MM.YYYY HH:MM"*.

## 2. Google Business Profile (GBP) Reply Publishing Flow
- **Interactive Details Panel Button**:
  - Automatically shows a premium **"Google'da Yayınla"** action button in the Reviews detail panel when the review source is Google, has a generated `ai_reply`/`response`, and the current status is `pending_approval` or `waiting_approval` (manager approved state).
  - Prompts the user with a clean window confirmation: *"Bu cevabı Google Business üzerinde yayınlamak istiyor musunuz?"*.
- **Database Status Logging Migration**:
  - Created database migration: **`supabase/migrations/20260703120000_add_google_reply_fields.sql`** and **`20260703122000_add_owner_reply_fields.sql`** to append tracking columns to the `reviews` schema:
    - `google_reply_status` / `owner_reply_status` (e.g. `'published'`, `'mock_published'`, `'error'`)
    - `google_reply_published_at` / `owner_reply_published_at` (timestamp of publication)
    - `google_reply_error` / `owner_reply_error` (log statement describing failure causes)
- **Status Badging**:
  - Reviews that have been successfully published on GBP render a clean, custom badge indicator next to their standard statuses in the main reviews cards list: **`Google'da Yayınlandı`**.
- **Consolidated Endpoint Routing**:
  - Integrated the publication logic inside `api-services/googleReplyService.ts` and the unified serverless endpoint handler `publish-google-reply` inside `api/reviews.ts`. Correctly falls back to mock logging if location credentials are missing.

---

## 3. Chrome INP (Interaction to Next Paint) Performance Optimization
- **Deferred Asynchronous Action Wrapper (setTimeout)**:
  - Wrapped all heavy/blocking actions inside `ReviewDetailPanel.tsx` (AI response generation, translation, WhatsApp sharing, saving manager notes, GBP publishing, task creation) and `Reviews.tsx` (Sync all platforms) inside `setTimeout(() => ..., 50)` boundaries.

## 3. Chrome INP (Interaction to Next Paint) Performance Optimization
- **Deferred Asynchronous Action Wrapper (setTimeout)**:
  - Wrapped all heavy/blocking actions inside `ReviewDetailPanel.tsx` (AI response generation, translation, WhatsApp sharing, saving manager notes, GBP publishing, task creation) and `Reviews.tsx` (Sync all platforms) inside `setTimeout(() => ..., 50)` boundaries.
  - This allows the main thread to immediately paint the active loader/disabled state (e.g. `setIsPublishing(true)`, `setIsSavingDraft(true)`, etc.) before executing heavy tasks or showing synchronous dialog windows (`window.confirm`/`window.alert`), avoiding Chrome INP warning blocks.
- **Component Memoization (`React.memo`)**:
  - Memoized the `ReviewCard` component to prevent all items in the reviews list from drawing again on every detail panel update or selection change.
- **Stable Callback References (`useCallback` / state setter passing)**:
  - Memoized all callback handlers inside `Reviews.tsx` (`handleUpdateStatus`, `handleSubmitResponse`, `handlePublishGoogleReply`, `handleSaveDraft`, `handleUpdateNotes`, `handleGenerateAiReply`) using React's `useCallback` hook.
  - Replaced inline arrow handlers `onClick={() => setSelectedReviewId(review.id)}` inside reviews list mappings with stable onSelect setter prop references `onSelect={setSelectedReviewId}` so that `ReviewCard`'s memoization is 100% effective.
- **### 5. Actor Stabilization & Schema Explicit Selection**
- Replaced stale generic `select('*')` statements on `hotels` with explicit column selectors across `hotelRepository.ts`, `Reviews.tsx`, `api/reviews.ts`, and `api/admin.ts`. This resolves PostgREST schema cache errors.
- Updated Booking.com review scraper on Apify to target `voyager/booking-reviews-scraper` with appropriate limit variables. Added comprehensive error message propagation to client.

### 6. Booking.com Yorum Metni Eşleme Düzeltmeleri
- **Eşleme Öncelik Sıralaması**: `reviewText` -> `review` -> `text` -> `comment` -> `pros` + `cons` (veya `liked` + `disliked` / `positiveText` + `negativeText`) -> `"No comment review."`
- **İlk 10 Ham JSON Örneği**:

## Verification & Deployment

We verified the build:
```bash
## 16. Duplicate Check Field Preservation & Backfill

We corrected a logical gap where duplicate check skips blocked dates and metadata backfilling:

- **Duplicate Check Selection**: Updated duplicate queries in [reviews.ts](file:///c:/Users/USER/OneDrive/Desktop/HOTELREVIEW/ecctur-review-ai/api/reviews.ts) to select `review_date, metadata, travel_date, owner_response_text, owner_response_date` values for duplicate records.
- **Backfill/Update Logic**:
  * Added active checking for date or metadata presence on duplicate records. If a duplicate review is identified, but lacks `review_date` or `metadata` (imported in prior sessions), we now trigger an `.update()` to write the correct `review_date` and metadata values.
  * Added `console.log("[BOOKING FINAL INSERT PAYLOAD]", reviewRecord)` and `console.log("[BOOKING FINAL UPDATE PAYLOAD]", updatePayload)` logs.
